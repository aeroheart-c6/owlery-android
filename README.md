Owlery
=========

A convenience wrapper for using the HttpURLConnection class which should allow it to be signed via
OAuth. Currently, the built-in OAuth version for use is OAuth 1.0a which is being used by Plurk.

This is still a massively work-in-progress project. Expect it to have bugs. Lots of it.
